# CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

The details of the Stanford CS class **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition** can be found here https://cs231n.github.io.

Previously, I have completed several Machine Learning / Deep Learning  courses on Coursera.com. Taking this class will help me to get better what I have already learned.

Here is the course outline:

**Module 0: Preparation:**
- Software Setup
- Python / Numpy Tutorial
- Google Cloud Tutorial

**Module 1: Neural Networks:**
- Image Classification: Data-Driven Approach, k-Nearest Neighbor, Train/Val/Test Splits

**Module 2: Convolutional Neural Networks**
