# CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

The details of the Stanford CS class **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition** can be found here https://cs231n.github.io.

Previously, I have completed several Machine Learning / Deep Learning  courses on Coursera.com. Taking this class will help me to get better what I have already learned.

Here is the course **CS231n** outline:

**Module 0: Preparation:**
- Software Setup
- Python / Numpy Tutorial
- Google Cloud Tutorial

**Module 1: Neural Networks:**
- Image Classification: Data-Driven Approach, k-Nearest Neighbor, Train/Val/Test Splits
- Linear Classification: Support Vector Machine, Softmax
- Optimization: Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Backpropagation, Intuitions
- Neutral Networks Part 1: Setting up the Architecture
- Neutral Networks Part 2: Setting up the Data and the Loss
- Neutral Networks Part 3: Learning and Evaluation
- Putting it all Together: Minimal Neural Network Case Study

**Module 2: Convolutional Neural Networks**
- Convolutional Neural Networks: Architectures, Convolution / Pooling Layers
- Understanding and Visualizing Convolutional Neural Networks
- Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Convolutional Neural Networks

As you reading the description of this **CS231n** course online https://cs231n.github.io, much of the background and materials were taken from ImageNet Challenge, http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/index.
