# CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

The details of the Stanford CS class **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition** can be found here https://cs231n.github.io.

Previously, I have completed several Machine Learning / Deep Learning  courses on Coursera.com. Taking this class will help me to get better what I have already learned.
