# CS231n - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

The details of the Stanford CS class **CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition** can be found here https://cs231n.github.io.

Previously, I have completed several Machine Learning / Deep Learning  courses on Coursera.com. Taking this class will help me to get better what I have already learned.

Here is the course outline:

0. Module 0: Preparation
  - Software Setup
  - Python / Numpy Tutorial
  - Google Cloud Tutorial
1. Module 1: Neural Networks
2. Module 2: Convolutional Neural Networks
